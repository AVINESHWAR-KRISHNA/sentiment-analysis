adding anything is done in the same way you create a calendar event. the 
""routine"" function is a missed opportunity in that i think it will help me 
establish a morning routine for myself but in reality it's about creating 
calendar events that repeat, a slightly expanded component of any free 
calendar our there. when i think of ""tuning my time spent"" i'm thinking, 
better organization for smaller tasks. then find myself spending an hour 
setting 1 minute events for myself that i was never actually notified about

5144,this app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned liferpg app and from a bit of digging so far i'm impressed. some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so i'll probably bite on that once i've set up everything and used the app a bit. one suggestion i'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events - like bringing up a reminder when i'm near the gym or store.,2,positive,1,1,2,0

5020,"this is a re-review. this could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smart/auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. just don't confuse the 'game' in rpg for any actual gameplay; but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. however do it now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. after a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. while auto-grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. user defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them- but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. with no social aspect currently attached to the app (as at ver 2.23.0) there is no task sharing. there is also no designated pc/mac/linux front end for desktop syncing. finally it's expensive as apps go. a one off of $75 will get the full version, or about $2.50 a month (paid yearly), which removes ads and gives calendar access. original review: ""a good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. it would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader.""",1,neutral,0,0,2,2

8220,"is it true that non-premium version soon will loose any way for backup/restore or transfer to another phone? if not true: please point to me what is the backup/restore way that stays in app in the future. thanks a lot!. if true: that is really bad news - backup is a basic necessity, so non-premium version will become practically useless on the long term. in addition, premium costs twice as much for a single year than, let's say osmand+ for eternity. and that is a much more complex app + the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits. tasks is a really nice app (except that swichingt between sublists/lists is unreasonably slow) with some unique and essential features. but this wracks it, it will drive me away. possibly others too. not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that. response to steven nottage's response: that is fair enough, except for one important detail: all the people using your free app are now forced to decide - if they want to have a meaningful app - to pay or search for another app. premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities. if you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing, people will buy it. lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them, now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay. i payed for a number of apps (all cheaper than yours btw.), and actually my plan was to pay/donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear, because i thought the app is really useful and it deserves support. this change is different. i do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc., just that you should not remove the free local backup (or any other feature). or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start. best wishes! response to steven nottage's second response: actually you can clearly see from my review that i do not want everything for free. my problem is different. if we could not understand each other so far, perhaps it's not worth trying any more. so i won't comment on the rest of your answer. all the best!",1,neutral,1,0,2,1
